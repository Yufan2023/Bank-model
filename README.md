#  Stock Prediction Project with LSTM and Sentiment Analysis 


## Project Overview
This project predicts the stock prices of TD Bank using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. It incorporates:

## Features
Multivariate Time Series Analysis: Uses historical stock and economic data. <br>
Sentiment Integration: Performs sentiment analysis using VADER on political news headlines.<br>
Event Indicators: Marks significant political events (e.g., elections, economic agreements).<br>
Deep Learning Model: Predicts historical trends and future stock prices using LSTM.<br>
Visualization: Displays actual vs. predicted prices and future forecasts.<br>

Historical stock data: Closing prices of major banks and financial sectors.<br>
Economic indicators: Interest rates, volatility index, and S&P 500.<br>
Political dynamics: Sentiment analysis of political news and event-based indicators.<br>
The model forecasts both historical trends and future stock prices while analyzing the impact of political and economic factors.<br>

## Project Structure

src/

This folder contains the core scripts essential for the project:

main.py: The primary script responsible for training and evaluating the stock prediction model.

data_loader.py: Handles the downloading of both historical and future stock data.

preprocessing.py: Contains the logic for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

model.py: Includes code for creating, training, saving, and loading the model.

sentiment_analysis.py: Script dedicated to performing sentiment analysis.

collect_future_data.py: Runs periodically to gather future data.

utils.py: Consists of utility functions used for plotting and evaluating model performance.

models/

This directory stores the trained models. For example, the LSTM model is saved as lstm_model.h5.

results/

This folder is used to store output results, visual plots, and log files generated during the project.

tests/

Contains unit test scripts to validate the functionality of the code:

test_data_loader.py: Tests for the data loading module.

test_preprocessing.py: Tests related to data preprocessing.

test_model.py: Verifies the model creation and training logic.

test_sentiment_analysis.py: Ensures the sentiment analysis script is functioning correctly.

test_collect_future_data.py: Checks the periodic data collection script.

requirements.txt

Lists all Python libraries and dependencies needed for the project.

.gitignore

Specifies files and folders to exclude from version control.

README.md
